# Importing raw data tables directly from the Bronze layer.
# These tables represent unprocessed, original data ingested from source systems (e.g., ERP, CRM).
# Note: No transformations or cleansing applied at this stage â€“ this is the first stage of the data pipeline.

  # TODO: Add validation checks or apply a cleansing layer before moving to silver/gold
# This will help maintain data quality in downstream reporting
